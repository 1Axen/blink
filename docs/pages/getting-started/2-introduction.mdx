# Introduction

This guide is aimed towards CLI users, any syntax will apply to the Studio plugin as well.

## First Steps

<Steps>

### Writing Your First Network Description

Blink's language is really simple, you will learn more throught the guide.<br />
First create a `.blink` file in your desired directory, then copy the example below into your file:

```blink copy
-- these can be ignored if you are using the studio plugin
option ClientOutput = "path/to/client.luau"
option ServerOutput = "path/to/server.luau"

event MyFirstEvent {
    from: Server,
    type: Reliable,
    call: SingleSync,
    data: string
}
```

### Compile Your Network Description

Open a terminal in the directory you created your file and run the following command:

```sh copy
blink FILE_NAME
```

This will generate 2 Luau files, "path/to/client.luau" and "path/to/server.luau".
You can now use these files in your project.

### Using The Generated Code

Blink returns an immutable table with all of your events and functions.
Using this table you can connect to your events and or functions and fire/invoke them.

```lua copy filename="server" {3}
local Net = require(Path.To.Server)

Net.MyFirstEvent.FireAll("Hello World")
```

```lua copy filename="client" {3-5}
local Net = require(Path.To.Client)

Net.MyFirstEvent.On(function(Text)
    print(Text)
end)
```

</Steps>
