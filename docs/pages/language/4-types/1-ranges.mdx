# Ranges
Ranges can be used with various types like: [Numbers](2-numbers.mdx), [Strings](./3-strings.mdx), [Arrays](./5-arrays.mdx) etc. 
to limit the extents of their representable values.

## Full Ranges
A full range is one with both a minimum and maximum value.<br/>
An example full range from `0` to `100` is written like: `0..100`.

## Half Ranges
A half range is one where only a minimum or maximum value is given.<br/>
These are written like: `0..` or `..100`.

## Exact Ranges
An exact range has only one value, such as `0` or `100`.

## Examples
|Range|Min|Max|
|-----|---|---|
|`0..100`|`0`|`100`|
|`0..`|`0`|`+infinity`|
|`..100`|`-infinity`|`100`|
|`0`|`0`|`0`|
|`100`|`100`|`100`|
