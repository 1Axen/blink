# Enums
Blink supports two types of enums, unit and tagged enums.

## Unit Enums
Units enums represent a set of possible values.<br/>
They are defined using the `enum` type. 
For example, a unit enum representing the state of a character:
```ts copy
type CharacterStatus = enum { Idling, Walking, Running, Jumping, Falling }
```

## Tagged Enums
Tagged enums are a set of possible variants, each with some data attached.<br/>
They are defined using the `enum` type, then a string which is used for the tag field name, followed by the variants.
Each variant is defined by a tag, followed by a struct. Variants are separated by a comma.

```ts copy
enum MouseEvent = "Type" {
    Move {
        Delta: vector,
        Position: vector,
    },
    Drag {
        Delta: vector,
        Position: vector,
    },
    Click {
        Button: enum { Left, Right, Middle },
        Position: vector
    }
}
```

Tagged enums are a very powerful way to represent many different types of data.<br/>
While not supported by blink, a union type can be substituted using tagged enums:
``` ts copy
enum Union = "Type" {
    Number {
        Value: f64
    },
    String {
        Value: string
    }
}
```
This would result in the following Luau type:
```lua copy
type Union = 
    | {Type: "Number", Value: number}
    | {Type: "String", Value: string}
```

### Generics
Like [maps](./8-maps.mdx), tagged enums also support generics.<br/>
For example, a tagged enum union template can be defined as:
```ts copy
enum Union<A, B> = "Type" {
    A {
        Value: A
    },
    B {
        Value: B
    },
}

enum NumberStringUnion = Union<number, string>
```
