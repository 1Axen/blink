# Vectors
Vectors represent a vector in 3D space, most often as a point in 3D space.<br/>
They can be defined using the `vector` type.

## Bounding Vectors
The length (magnitude) of vectors can be bounded by placing [a range](./1-ranges.mdx) within parenthesis after the type.<br/>
For example, if you wanted to create a unit vector (length between `0` and `1`) you can do:
```ts copy
vector(0..1)
```

## Specifying Encoding
Vectors can be passed a [number type](./2-numbers.mdx) within angular brackets after the type, to be used for encoding.
For example, an `i16` vector can be defined like so:
```ts copy
type VectorI16 = vector<i16>
```
<Callout type="warning">
    Since Luau stores vectors as three `f32`s internally, any encoding larger than a `f32` (ex. `f64`) will have no real effect on the numerical precision of the vector.

## Example Usage
```ts
type Position = vector
type UnitVector = vector(0..1)
type VectorU8 = vector<u8>
```
