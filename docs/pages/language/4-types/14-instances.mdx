# Instances
Blink supports Roblox instances. They can be defined using the `Instance` type.
```ts copy
type AnInstance = Instance
```
<Callout type="error">
    If a non-optional instance results in `nil` on the receiving side, it will raise a deserialization error, and the rest of the data will be dropped.
    Instances turning `nil` can be caused by many things, for example: instance streaming, instances that only exist on the sender's side, etc.<br/>
    If you plan on sending instances that might not exist, you must mark them [optional](./7-optionals.mdx).
</Callout>

## Specifying Class
Instances can be further narrowed by specifying their class, for example:
```ts copy
type Player = Instance(Player)
```

<Callout type="info">
    Subclasses of the specified class will also be accepted.<br/>
    For example, an Instance typed as `BasePart` will also accept a `Part`.
</Callout>
