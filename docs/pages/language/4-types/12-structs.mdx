# Structs
Structs are a fixed set of statically named keys and values.<br/>
They can be defined using the `struct` type. For example, a struct representing a theoretical game entity would look like:
```ts copy
struct Entity {
    Health: u8(0..100),
    Position: vector,
    Rotation: u8,
    Animations: struct {
        First: u8?,
        Second: u8,
        Third: u8
    }
}
```

## Merging
Structs can "merge" other structs into themselves, this is equivalent to a table union in Luau.<br/>
A merge is defined using two dots followed by the identifier of the target struct.
```ts copy
struct foo {
    foo: u8
}

struct bar {
    bar: string
}

struct foo_bar {
    ..foo,
    ..bar
}
```
The resulting Luau type for `foo_bar` would look like so:
```lua copy
type foo_bar = { foo: number, bar: string }
```

## Generics
Structs, like [maps](./8-maps.mdx) and [tagged enums](./10-enums#tagged-enums), support the use of generics.<br/>
For example, a packet fragment can be typed using generic structs:
```ts copy
struct Fragment<T> {
    Index: u8,
    Sequence: u16,
    Fragments: u8,
    Data: T 
}

type EntitiesFragment = Fragment<Entity[]>
```
