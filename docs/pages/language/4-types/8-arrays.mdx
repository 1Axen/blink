# Arrays
Arrays are a list of homogeneous types.<br/>
They can be defined as a type followed by square brackets.<br/>
For example an array of `string`s would be:
```ts copy
string[]
```

## Bounding Arrays
The length of arrays can be bounded by placing [a range](./1-ranges.mdx) within the square brackets.<br/>
For example, if you wanted to bound the length of an array between `25` and `50` elements you can do:
```ts copy
string[25..50]
```

## Example Usage
```ts copy
type UserIds = f64[1..50]
```
