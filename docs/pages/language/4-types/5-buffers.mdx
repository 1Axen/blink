# Buffers
Buffers can be defined using the `buffer` type.<br/>
Buffers allow you to pass your own custom serialized data while still taking advantage of blink's batching.

## Bounding Buffers
The length of buffers can be bounded by placing [a range](./1-ranges.mdx) within parenthesis after the type.<br/>
For example, if you wanted to bound a buffer between `0` and `900` bytes, you can do:
```ts copy
buffer(..900)
```

## Example Usage
```ts copy
type BinaryBlob = buffer
type UnreliableEventBuffer = buffer(..950)
```
