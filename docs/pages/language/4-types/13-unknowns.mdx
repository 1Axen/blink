# Unknowns
The `unknown` type represents values which cannot be known until runtime.<br/>
For unions, use [tagged enums](./10-enums#tagged-enums) instead.
<Callout type="info">
    Unknowns should be used sparingly as they utilize Roblox's serialization format thus negating most of the benefits of Blink.
