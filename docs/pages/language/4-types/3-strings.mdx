# Strings
Strings are Luau's text container, in blink a string can be defined using the `string` type.

## Bounding Strings
The length of strings can be bounded by placing [a range](./1-ranges.mdx) within parenthesis after the type.<br/>
For example, if you wanted to bound a string between `3` and `20` characters you can do:
```ts copy
string(3..20)
```

## Example Usage
```ts copy
type UUID = string(36)
type Username = string(3..20)
```
<Callout type="warning">
    This example assumes a username between 3 and 20 characters, but that may not always be the case in practice.
</Callout>
