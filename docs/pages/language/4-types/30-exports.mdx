# Exports
Blink supports exporting write and read functions for a specific type.<br/>
Exports can be a powerful way to leverage your blink types in various use-cases like: automatic ECS replication.<br/>
An export can be defined by prefixing the `export` keyword to a type's definition, for example:
```ts copy
export struct MyInterface = {
    field: u8,
}
```

<Callout type="info">
    Exports do not currently support Instances and Unknowns.
</Callout>

## Usage in Luau
The Luau facing API looks like so:
```lua
type MyInterfaceExport = {
    Read: (buffer) -> MyInterface,
    Write: (MyInterface) -> buffer
}
```
And a game script can use it like so:
```lua filename="example.lua" copy
local Serialized = blink.MyInterface.Write(MyInterface)
local Deserialized = blink.MyInterface.Read(Serialized)
```
