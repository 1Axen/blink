# CFrames
CFrames represent a point and rotation about it in 3D space, most often as a point in 3D space.<br/>
They can be defined using the `CFrame` type.

```ts copy
type Location = CFrame
```

## Specifying Encoding
CFrames can be passed two [number types](./2-numbers.mdx) within angular brackets after the type, to be used for the positional and rotational encoding respectively.
For example, a CFrame which uses an `i16` for it's positional encoding and a `f16` for it's rotational encoding can be defined like so:
```ts copy
type MyCFrame = CFrame<i16, f16>
```
<Callout type="warning">
    The numerical precision limitations of [vectors](./6-vectors.mdx#specifying-encoding) also apply to CFrames.<br/>
    Furthermore, using an [integer type](./2-numbers.mdx#unsigned-integers) for the rotational encoding will result in the rotation being zeroed out.
