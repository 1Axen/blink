# Scopes
Scopes allow you to group similiar types together for better per-file organization.

## Defining Scopes
You can define a scope using the `scope` keyword followed by the scope name.
```blink copy
scope ExampleScope {
    type InScopeType = u8
    event InScopeEvent {
        From: Server,
        Type: Reliable,
        Call: SingleSync,
        Data: u8
    }
}

struct Example {
    Reference = ExampleScope.InScopeType
}
```
<Callout type="info">
    Scopes automatically capture any definitions within their parent scopes.
    ```blink copy
    type Outer = u8
    scope CaptureExample {
        type Inner = Outer
    }
    ``` 
</Callout>
## Usage in Luau code
Whenever a type or event/function is defined within a scope, their export is nested within the scope's table, and their luau type is prefixed with the scope's name.
```lua copy
local Blink = require(PATH_TO_BLINK)
Blink.ExampleScope.InScopeEvent.FireAll(0)

local Number: Blink.ExampleScope_InScopeType = 0
```
