# Options
Options go at the top of a source file, and allow you to configure the output of Blink.
```ts copy
option [OPTION] = [VALUE]
```

## `Casing`
Default: `Pascal`  
Options: `Pascal`, `Camel`, `Snake`  

Controls the casing with which event/function methods generate.
```ts copy
option Casing = Camel
```

## `ServerOutput`, `ClientOutput`, `TypesOutput`
These options allow you to specify where Blink will generate the respective output files.
```ts copy
option TypesOutput = "../Network/Types.luau"
option ServerOutput = "../Network/Server.luau"
option ClientOutput = "../Network/Client.luau"
```

## `Typescript`
Default: `false`  

Tells Blink whether to generate TypeScript definition files alongside Luau files.  
The generated `d.ts` files are placed in the same path as your output files.
```ts copy
option Typescript = true
```

## `UsePolling`
Default: `false`

Instructs the compiler to automatically output all events with a polling API.
```ts copy
option UsePolling = true
```

## `FutureLibrary` and `PromiseLibrary`
In order to use future and promise yield types with functions a path to each library used must be specified  
```ts copy
option FutureLibrary = "ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Future"
option PromiseLibrary = "ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Promise"
```

## `SyncValidation`
Default: `false`

Controls if Blink will check whether a sync call yielded.

## `WriteValidations`
Default: `false`

Controls if Blink will check types when writing them (firing an event/invoking a function). Helpful for debugging and during development, but it might result in degraded performance. It is encouraged you disable this option in production.
<Callout>
    Blink only checks for builtin primitives. For example if a number was passed. More complicated types like structs, maps and enums cannot be validated.
</Callout>

## `ManualReplication`
Default: `false`

Controls if Blink will replicate events and functions automatically at the end of every frame.  
When set to `true` automatic replication will be disabled and a `StepReplication` function will be exposed instead.

## `RemoteScope`
Default: `""`

Adds a prefix to the events generated by this Blink instance. For example a value of `"PACKAGE"` creates events `"PACKAGE_BLINK_RELIABLE_REMOTE"` and `"PACKAGE_BLINK_UNRELIABLE_REMOTE"`.
If the option is not specified, they will just be `"BLINK_RELIABLE_REMOTE"` and `"BLINK_UNRELIABLE_REMOTE"`.<br/>
This is particularly useful if you're using Blink inside of a package, and don't want to interfere with a game's own Blink setup.
