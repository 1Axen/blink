# Imports
Imports allow you to split your blink config into multiple files for better organization.

## Importing Files
You can import another blink file using the `import` keyword followed by a file system path to the target file.<br/>
Imported files are placed in a new scope, using the file name or a user provided name through the `as` keyword.
<Callout type="info">
    Imports also work in the Roblox Studio editor, but only support sibling `(./)` imports.
</Callout>
```ts copy
import "./external"
import "./external" as "Common"

type ExternType = external.Type
type CommonType = Common.Type
```
## Usage in Luau code
Since imports act as scopes, the same rules apply to them as well.
```lua copy
local Blink = require(PATH_TO_BLINK)
Blink.external.Event.FireAll(0)

local Number: Blink.Common_Type = 0
```
