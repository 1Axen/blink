# Events
Events are Blink's version of Roblox's `ReliableEvent` and `UnreliableEvent`.<br/>
They are the main way to communicate between client and server.

## Usage in Blink

Events can be defined using the `event` keyword.
```blink copy
event MyEvent {
    From: Server,
    Type: Reliable,
    Call: SingleAsync,
    Data: f64
}
```

#### `From`
Determines the side from which the event is fired. <br/>
Currently Blink supports either `Server` or `Client`.

#### `Type`
Determines the type (reliability) of the event.
* `Reliable` - Events are guaranteed to arrive at their destination in the order they were sent in.
* `Unreliable` - Events are not guaranteed to arrive at their destination or to arrive in the order they were sent in. They also have a maximum size of 1000 bytes.

#### `Call`
Determines the listening API exposed on the receiving side.
* `SingleSync` - Events can only have one listener, but that listener cannot yield.
* `ManySync` - Events can have many listeners, but those listeners cannot yield.
* `SingleAsync` - Events can only have one listener, and that listener may yield.
* `ManyAsync` - Events can have many listeners, and those listeners may yield.
* `Polling` - Events are iterated through `Event.Iter()`.

<Callout type="error">
    Sync events should be avoided unless performance is critical.<br/>
    Yielding or erroring in sync event can cause <b>undefined and sometimes game-breaking behaviour</b>.
</Callout>

#### `Data`
Determines the data that is sent through the event, can be any [type](./4-types.mdx).<br/>
This field can be omitted if no data is required.

##### `Type Packs`
Multiple data values are supported through the usage of a type pack (commonly referred to as a tuple).
Type packs can be defined as a list of [types](./4-types.mdx) seperated by a comma within parenthesis.<br/>
For example, a type pack of different [number types](./4-types#numbers) can be written like so:
```blink  copy
event MyTypePackEvent {
    From: Server,
    Type: Reliable,
    Call: SingleAsync,
    Data: (u8, u16, u32)
}
```

## Usage in Luau

### Firing an Event
```lua filename="client.luau" copy
blink.MyEvent.Fire(5)
blink.MyTypePackEvent.Fire(2^8 - 1, 2^16 - 1, 2^32 - 1)
```
```lua filename="server.luau" copy
blink.MyEvent.Fire(Player, 5)
blink.MyEvent.FireAll(5)
blink.MyEvent.FireList({Player}, 5)
blink.MyEvent.FireExcept(Player, 5)
```

### Listening to an Event
```lua filename="client.luau" copy
blink.MyEvent.On(function(Value)
    -- ...
end)

blink.MyTypePackEvent.On(function(Foo, Bar, FooBar)
    -- ...
end)
```
```lua filename="server.luau" copy
blink.MyEvent.On(function(Player, Value)
    -- ...
end)

blink.MyTypePackEvent.On(function(Player, Foo, Bar, FooBar)
    -- ...
end)
```
```lua filename="disconnect.luau" copy
local Disconnect = blink.MyEvent.On(...)
Disconnect()
```

### Iterating an Event (Polling)
```lua filename="client.luau" copy
for Index, Value in MyEvent.Iter() do
    -- ...
end
for Index, Foo, Bar, FooBar in MyTypePackEvent.Iter() do
    -- ...
end
```
```lua filename="server.luau" copy
for Index, Player, Value in MyEvent.Iter() do
    -- ...
end
for Index, Player, Foo, Bar, FooBar in MyTypePackEvent.Iter() do
    -- ...
end
```
